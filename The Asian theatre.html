        <font face="Lato" color="#FFFFFF" size="5">The only country able to stop Japanese aggression, which by late 1941 encompassed an expansion of its continuing conflict with China and the acquisition of European colonial holdings in the Far East, was the United States, with Britain confronting Germany in Europe. More than 2,300 American soldiers lost their lives when 360 Japanese aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor, the main U.S. naval base in Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. The attack completely caught the Americans off guard. The Pearl Harbor attack helped to unite public opinion in the United States in support of joining World War II, and on December 8, Congress declared war on Japan with just one vote against it. The Axis Powers quickly declared war on the United States, led by Germany. The U.S. Pacific Fleet won the Battle of Midway in June 1942, which proved to be a turning point in the war after a succession of Japanese wins. From August 1942 until February 1943, the Allies successfully fought off Japanese forces on Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomon Islands, turning the tide in the Pacific. A series of amphibious assaults on significant Japanese-held islands in the Pacific were part of the Allied naval forces' aggressive counterattack against Japan that started in the middle of 1943. Success in this "island-hopping" tactic allowed the Allies to get closer to their eventual objective of conquering mainland Japan.</font>
